## Commit Proposal

Matrikel Number: 14-468-615

Project idea short description:

It's exactly a game like "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire".
Additional possibly features: Save your status (Maybe with an account), restart a new game

Other comments: 
I'm particular proud of: i've learnt a lot of html and js and about the framework grails
Used a lot fo javascript my project.

## Project grading 

Index.html given and valid html. Extensive use of <br> is not perfect.

The application works nicely (and is fun to play).

Functionality is a user-specific workflow with conversational state and 
elements of randomness. It can be used by multiple users. 
The UI is interactive, form-based. The conversation state
needs to keep track of the jokers. It is stored on the client. 
The quiz content is stored in the database.

Engineering:
- the commit log is well factored and shows a substantial effort over many days
- some basic tests are there
- comments are fine
- Web MVC is well used
- interesting dynamic JavaScript in combo with Grails Server Pages

I award some extra points for the technical challenge (GSP-JavaScript combo)
and the obviously visible extra effort that went into the solution.

Congratulations!
This is a professional-grade application that you can be really proud of.
You have set yourself a challenging goal and did pursue it despite the difficulties.
This is the hallmark of an engineer.

Grade: 6.0
